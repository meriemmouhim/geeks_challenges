**Title: "Blood & Vows"**  

**Chapter 1: The Alliance**  
Don Vittorio "The Viper" Moretti ruled New York's underworld with an iron fist. To end a brutal turf war, he arranged a marriage between his son, Don Luca Moretti, and the daughter of his rival, Don Salvatore Bianchiâ€”the beautiful, sharp-tongued Sofia Bianchi.  

Sofia had once been in loveâ€”a street artist named Marco, who was powerless against the mafiaâ€™s grip. When her father ordered her to marry Luca, she had no choice.  

**Chapter 2: The Obsession**  
Luca was ruthless, feared, and utterly obsessed with Sofia. He didnâ€™t just want her obedienceâ€”he wanted her love. He showered her with expensive gifts, whispered threats disguised as affection, and made sure every man who ever looked at her regretted it.  

But Sofiaâ€™s heart still ached for Marco.  

**Chapter 3: The Secret Letters**  
One evening, Sofia received a note slipped under her bedroom door:  

*"Meet me at the old pier. Midnight. Iâ€™ll get you out." â€”M*  

Her pulse raced. Marco was still trying to save her.  

**Chapter 4: The Escape Attempt**  
At midnight, Sofia crept through the mansion, heart poundingâ€”until Lucaâ€™s voice cut through the dark.  

*"Going somewhere, mia sposa?"*  

She turned slowly. Luca stood there, holding Marco by the throat, a knife pressed to his ribs.  

*"Did you really think I wouldnâ€™t know?"* Luca sneered.  

**Chapter 5: The Twist**  
Sofia dropped to her knees, begging for Marcoâ€™s life. Luca smirkedâ€”then suddenly slashed Marcoâ€™s throat.  

As Sofia screamed, Luca pulled her close, whispering:  

*"Youâ€™ll learn to love me."*  

But thenâ€”**gunshots.**  

Sofiaâ€™s father, Don Bianchi, stormed in with his men.  

*"Did you think Iâ€™d let you keep her?"* he snarled.  

Luca laughedâ€”**then shot Don Bianchi between the eyes.**  

Sofia realized too late: **This was never a truce.** Luca had planned it allâ€”the marriage, the war, even Marcoâ€™s return.  

Now, with both families in chaos, Luca gripped Sofiaâ€™s wrist.  

*"Now youâ€™re mine. Forever."*  

**Epilogue: The New Reign**  
Sofia sat beside Luca at his coronation as the new King of New Yorkâ€™s underworldâ€”her face blank, her spirit broken.  

But in the shadows, a figure watched.  

Marco wasnâ€™t dead.  

And he was coming for her.
